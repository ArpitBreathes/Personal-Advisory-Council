## 🎯 Judge Questions & Answers

### "How is this different from ChatGPT?"

**Answer**: "ChatGPT gives you one opinion. We give you Einstein, Steve Jobs, and Socrates debating, then synthesize their views. It's about diverse perspectives, not just one answer."

### "Can't users just ask ChatGPT multiple times?"

**Answer**: "They could, but they won't. We make it effortless - one question, three perspectives, automatic synthesis. Plus, the personas have consistent personalities across conversations."

### "How do you make money?"

**Answer**: "For hackathon, we're focused on student value. Future: freemium model - free for students, premium personas for professionals, or white-label for universities."

### "What about incorrect advice?"

**Answer**: "We're not replacing human judgment - we're augmenting it. The disclaimer is clear: these are AI perspectives to help you think, not decide for you. The synthesis especially helps users see trade-offs."

### "Why Google tech stack?"

**Answer**: "Gemini 1.5 Flash is perfect - fast, conversational, and 1,500 free requests daily. Firebase gives us real-time updates and scales automatically. All on free tier, perfect for students."
